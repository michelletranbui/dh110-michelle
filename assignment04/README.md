### The Purpose of UX Storytelling
> UX Storytelling is important for the purpose of understanding what the user needs, accomodating their motivations and desires, and to make their experience as easy, memorable, and satisfactory as possible. For my project, UX storytelling is imperative so I can modify and adjust Slim Palate to cater to a wide variety of people--from students, to full-time workers, and more. By imagining different populations of users, I can diversify the features, effectiveness, and utility of the website. 

### Design Features
##### 1. Short, Entertaining Videos
> Embed/link videos that are short and entertaining tutorials on how to make a certain dish.
##### 2. Categories & Filters
> Allow users to filter through specific cultural categories of food or genres of food.

### User Scenarios and Journey Maps 
#### Albert's Scenario
* Albert is still an undergraduate student studying Quantatitive Economics at the University of California, Irvine. He's aiming to graduate one year early, which means he's now very busy with classes, clubs, and organizations. Despite that, he still values taking care of his body by giving it the proper nutrients as well as working out to keep himself healthy and fit. Considering that he doesn't have that much time, he's been wanting to expand his cooking expertise by learning new recipes and techniques from different cultures. He only has about fourty-five minutes to spare in looking for a new, yummy, protein-rich meal, preparing it, eating it, and cleaning up. 
* Albert opens up Slim Palate in a new tab right after he finished studying to start preparing dinner. He wants to specifically look for meals that can be made in a short time frame, and is slightly panicked when he remembers how little time he has to eat. Luckily, Albert realizes that there's a feature that simply categories recipes into exactly what he's looking for! He finds the specific category of "Quick Meals" and browses around for 5 minutes to find something that is intriguing as well as having the proper intake that he needs (high in protein, lots of vegetables/fibers, healthy fats and carbohydrates). Albert's worried that it'll be difficult fo find something he wants to eat that also doesn't take a lot of time to make, and is somewhat overwhelmed by the plethora of "Quick Meals" that he has to navigate through. However, he finds out that he can further narrow down his search by adding in filters like "protein" or "lift heavy", which gave him meals that are specific to that type of target audience. He's able to find a recipe he wants to make at the end of the five minutes, and the recipe takes 10 minutes of prep, and 15 minutes to cook. There's even a short video that he can just watch as he cooks along. Albert is now feeling a little more calm after realizing how many of the meals suggested were very nutritious, delicious, and fulfilling. He now starts on the recipe, and is able to eat his meal at a nice, unrushed pace before he cleans up to catch up on a little more reading for his Urban Economics class.

#### Alondra's Scenario
* Alondra is a working adult, doing full-time and even overtime at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego, CA as a Physician's Assistant. Her mom had just recently passed away in the past six months and Alondra has been grieving her passing ever since. Sometimes, things get even harder because Alondra misses the home-style Mexican meals that her mother would make when she was little. She has been wanting to stay at home more to take care of her four-month old baby and three-year old, and to spend more time with her husband as well. Not only that, she's been feeling invigorated to learn how to make the delicious, nostalgic foods from her culture and heritage. Since she's still working as a PA, she doesn't have that much time to be learning, making mistakes, and discovering techniques for cooking. She also wants to reduce on how much her family eats out and to be able to make healthy, Mexican meals for her family. 
* Today is Alondra's day off, where she's been cleaning up around the house and taking care of the kids alongside her husband. She's just finished resting a little bit after doing some house chores, and wants to make a traditional Mexican dinner for her family. It's also a rare circumstance that she's off, so she can spend a little more time than usual in prepping and making dinner. In the future, she will be limited to one or two hours to make dinner for the family. 
* Alondra opens Slim Palate to find a traditional meal from her heritage. Her first impression of the website is that the recipes shown seem to be more American-style recipes that take a long time to prepare and make. She's distraught at being unable to find true, nostalgic recipes that might taste the way her mother made them. However, she realizes that there's a category dedicated to cultural, home-style meals. Even better is that there are traditional Mexican foods like tinga, pozole rojo and enchiladas verdes con pollo. After using the categories, she's discovered a wide variety of authentic foods that don't take a long time to prepare. Alondra was also pleasantly surprised that the recipes showed shortcuts and tips that would allow her to save time and be efficient as she lets the food cook, letting her multi-task and take care of the kids at the same time. Alondra is getting excited and emotional at finally being able to find a resource that lets her cook delicious food of her family, where she can remember the love of her mother at the same time.
