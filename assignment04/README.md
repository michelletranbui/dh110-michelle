### The Purpose of UX Storytelling
> UX Storytelling is important for the purpose of understanding what the user needs, accomodating their motivations and desires, and to make their experience as easy, memorable, and satisfactory as possible. For my project, UX storytelling is imperative so I can modify and adjust a Cooking Website to cater to a wide variety of people--from students, to full-time workers, and more. By imagining different populations of users, I can diversify the features, effectiveness, and utility of the website. 

### Design Features
##### 1. Short, Entertaining Videos
> Embed/link videos that are short and entertaining tutorials on how to make a certain dish.
##### 2. Categories & Filters
> Allow users to filter through specific cultural categories of food or genres of food.

### User Scenarios and Journey Maps 
#### Albert's Scenario
* Albert is still an undergraduate student studying Quantatitive Economics at the University of California, Irvine. He's aiming to graduate one year early, which means he's now very busy with classes, clubs, and organizations. Despite that, he still values taking care of his body by giving it the proper nutrients as well as working out to keep himself healthy and fit. Considering that he doesn't have that much time, he's been wanting to expand his cooking expertise by learning new recipes and techniques from different cultures. He only has about fourty-five minutes to spare in looking for a new, yummy, protein-rich meal, preparing it, eating it, and cleaning up.
