# The Accessibility of Streaming Sites

## Digital Humanities 110 - Michelle Tran Bui
Thinking back to what websites and apps I use the most, streaming websites came to the top of the list. More often than not, I watch animes on my free time. The two websites that I frequent the most when looking for something new is KissAnime and Crunchyroll. Both websites have different shows that in their catalogue, as well as varying levels of video quality and uplooad speeds. On both streaming platforms, my core task is to browse through the homepage for an anime to watch and observe the usability issues between the two anime streaming websites.

### KissAnime
> KissAnime is a mildly popular anime streaming website that has frequent updates of new episodes and new shows. Many of the most popular ongoing animes are consistently uploaded, but sometimes the episodes are not of the highest video and/or audio quality. Dubbed animes, which are when the voices are 'dubbed' over in English rather than being spoken in the traditional Japanese language are also available to watch on KissAnime.

#### Evaluation
> Overall: 


Heuristic | Evaluation | Improvement
--------- | ---------- | -----------
**Visibility of system status** | **Good**: Images of shows and the show title darken when hovering over them.  Various buttons and actions throughout the homepage also darken when hovering. **Bad**: Shows that I'm currently watching are not displayed on the homepage. Instead, popular and new shows are displayed rather than shows that are relevant to me. | **Improvement**: Shows the user are currently watching could be displayed on the homepage for ease of access, as well as the progress of that show. 
**Match between system + real world** | **Good**: There are arrows to scroll through more shows, as well as a search bar to specifically find something. **Bad**: There is an "Advanced Search" button, which is vague as to what that entails. Animes are displayed with their Japanese title despite being an American streaming platform. | **Improvement**: Modify the "Advanced Search" option to be more concise on what it does and change the titles of animes to their American name rather than their Japanese name. 
**User control and freedom** | **Bad**: There is no obvious "Go Back" button besides the "Back" on your Internet engine. After clicking on a new show, the only user freedom is selecting the "Home" button. Clicking on a specific episode also has no navigation to the show's general page, and you are only given the choice to select through more episodes. | **Improvement**: There should be an option to go back to the pages you were originally browsing through, even after clicking on a certain show. Another button to go back to the anime's general page would also be useful. 
**Conistency and standards** | **Good**: There is a consistent structure to the format of shows and opening episodes. There is also consistency between presenting "Ongoing" animes versus "Completed" animes, as well as what episode the anime is currently on. | **No Improvement**: The standardization throughout the homepage and navigating animes is done conventionally well. There is nothing to modify in regards to increasing consistency.
**Recognition rather than recall** |
