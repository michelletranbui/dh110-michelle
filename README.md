# The Accessibility of Streaming Sites

## Digital Humanities 110 - Michelle Tran Bui
Thinking back to what websites and apps I use the most, streaming websites came to the top of the list. More often than not, I watch animes on my free time. The two websites that I frequent the most when looking for something new is KissAnime and Crunchyroll. Both websites have different shows that in their catalogue, as well as varying levels of video quality and uplooad speeds. On both streaming platforms, my core task is to browse through the homepage for an anime to watch and observe the usability issues between the two anime streaming websites.

### KissAnime
> KissAnime is a mildly popular anime streaming website that has frequent updates of new episodes and new shows. Many of the most popular ongoing animes are consistently uploaded, but sometimes the episodes are not of the highest video and/or audio quality. Dubbed animes, which are when the voices are 'dubbed' over in English rather than being spoken in the traditional Japanese language are also available to watch on KissAnime.

#### Evaluation
> Overall: Although KissAnime has a great variety of animes to choose from, there are still many design issues before it becomes as sleek, modern, and useful as popular streaming platforms like Netflix. To better improve the user experience, KissAnime needs to become more personalized for the user and have features that will streamline accessing the website. There are many navigation, efficiency, and aesthetic issues on the website that build into the usability problems. 


Heuristic | Evaluation | Improvement
--------- | ---------- | -----------
**Visibility of system status** | **Good**: Images of shows and the show title darken when hovering over them.  Various buttons and actions throughout the homepage also darken when hovering. **Bad**: Shows that I'm currently watching are not displayed on the homepage. Instead, popular and new shows are displayed rather than shows that are relevant to me. | **Improvement**: Shows the user are currently watching could be displayed on the homepage for ease of access, as well as the progress of that show. 
**Match between system + real world** | **Good**: There are arrows to scroll through more shows, as well as a search bar to specifically find something. **Bad**: There is an "Advanced Search" button, which is vague as to what that entails. Animes are displayed with their Japanese title despite being an American streaming platform. | **Improvement**: Modify the "Advanced Search" option to be more concise on what it does and change the titles of animes to their American name rather than their Japanese name. 
**User control and freedom** | **Bad**: There is no obvious "Go Back" button besides the "Back" on your Internet engine. After clicking on a new show, the only user freedom is selecting the "Home" button. Clicking on a specific episode also has no navigation to the show's general page, and you are only given the choice to select through more episodes. | **Improvement**: There should be an option to go back to the pages you were originally browsing through, even after clicking on a certain show. Another button to go back to the anime's general page would also be useful. 
**Conistency and standards** | **Good**: There is a consistent structure to the format of shows and opening episodes. There is also consistency between presenting "Ongoing" animes versus "Completed" animes, as well as what episode the anime is currently on. | **No Improvement**: The standardization throughout the homepage and navigating animes is done conventionally well. There is nothing to modify in regards to increasing consistency.
**Recognition rather than recall** | **Good**: The search engine recognizes your search before you complete it and gives you suggestions. The most popular animes are also presented rather than forcing user memory recall. If you've watched an episode, the episode's title is darker to indicate that you've watched it. **Bad**: Shows that you are currently watching are not shown anywhere, forcing users to remember what episode of whichever anime they are watching. You could also have uncompleted episodes but KissAnime only indicates that you've watched it, and doesn't remember where you have stopped. | **Improvement**: Have a dedicated area to shows that you are watching as well as save the episode progress.
**Error prevention** | **Bad**: If there is a typo in your spelling of the anime's title, the engine can not help you look for similar spellings. Any accidental clicking of an episode that is saved as "Watched" can not be undone either. | **Improvement**: The search engine can be more flexible and accomodating to users' searches and there should be an option to modify the progress of a show. 
**Flexibility and efficiency of use** | **Good**: There is customization and personalization of the animes that you've already watched. There is also the ability to "bookmark" specific shows so that you can return to them, but that is only useful if you have created a profile with the account. The "bookmarks" are a shortcut to a specific anime. **Bad**: There is still extra navigation if you're looking for a very niche show or a show that you forgot to save. | **Improvement**: Reduce the amount of steps to navigate to a show and a specific episode, as well as the amount of steps to return to a show that has been saved. 
**Aesthetic and minimalist design** | **Bad**: The design of the website is outdated and not pleasing to look at. The typography is a little messy and overwheming in some areas, and the structure of the buttons/blocks are very sharp and harsh. | **Improvements**: Round out the harsh edges throughout the website and update the design to be more modern and sleek. 
**Help users with errors** | **Bad**: Error notifications are vague and take a long time to load. There are incomprehensible error codes and no solutions are given to the problem. | **Improvements**: Specify what the problem is and omit any unnecessary error codes. Solutions should also be given rather than not helping the user with the issue at hand whatsoever.
**Help and documentation** | **Bad**: There is no FAQ or page that has documentation of common issues and problems with the website. The only resource is to report issues through Facebook messages, which is an unneccesary step for users to find solutions or explanations on their issues. | **Improvements**: Have a dedicated FAQ page that has documentation of most commonly asked questions or problems to smoothen out the process for users.
