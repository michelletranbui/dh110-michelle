# The Accessibility of Streaming Sites

## Digital Humanities 110 - Michelle Tran Bui
Thinking back to what websites and apps I use the most, Netflix and Crunchyroll came to the top of that list. I frequently use these two streaming platforms to relax in my free time and search for new shows to watch--which are typically animes. With Netflix being one of the most, if not the most popular streaming platform, it's design is quite seamless and easy to navigate. On both streaming platforms, my core task is to search for an anime and observe the usability issues between the top American streaming platform Netflix, and the top anime streaming platform Crunchyroll.
