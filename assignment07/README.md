# Interactive Prototypying

## Digital Humanities 110 by Michelle Tran Bui 

### Tasks
The purpose of the high-fidelity prototype is to see whether or not my design of 'Slim Palate' is cognitively functional, if the impression on users is positive or negative, and what further user feedback can be discovered to adjust and improve the prototype. The prototyping also serves to discover any mistakes in the design and to fix them immediately to ensure that the user experience is simple and seamless.

The tasks that will be demonstrated will be the incorporation of three features:

> Favorites Bookmark: The Favorites Bookmark gives the user the ability to save recipes they want to use in the future, and users can access all their favorited recipes in a specific tab.

> Recipe Time Tool: The Recipe Time tool finds recipes that is within the time frame you need it to be, allowing the user to personalize their needs and find what they need faster.

> Recommendation Tool: The Recommendation tool features a multitude of categories like the genre/ethnicity/culture of the food as well as what category of food you are looking to make (ie. food for maintaining weight, bulking food, cutting food, comfort food, energy-rich food).
