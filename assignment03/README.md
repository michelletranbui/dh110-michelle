# Contextual Inquiry: Users in Context 
## Digital Humanities 110 - Michelle Tran Bui 

### Step 1: The Main Design Challenge 
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in doing? 
The project would need to support the users in applying for unemployment benefits that are funded by hte government. Users who do not have a job or had their hours reduced would need to be able to access the website to submit necessary information in order to apply for unemployment benefits, as well as keep track of their claim, claim  process, claim history, and other relevant information. This would hopefully serve the community of people who have been impacted by the pandemic and have lost work hours/their job--prior to the pandemic, it would serve the community of people who are struggling with job security and making enough money to survive. 
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
The basic need involved in this activity fulfills the user's  physiological needs as the user is applying for monetary support. If the user were to use the website and indeed receive unemployment benefits, the money the user would receive would be most likely allocated to their physiological needs of food, water, warmth, and rest. It is possible that the unemployment benefits would be allocated to self-actualisation if the money was used for personal needs and wants. 
#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs? 
The current solution to satisfy these needs are to only access this specific organization/publisher, as this is governmentally run. It is possible to satisfy this specific need by applying in person or over the phone, but the in-person option might be limited considering it is COVID-19. Traditional solutions prior to the invention/widespread access of the internet was to apply for unemployment benefits were to only apply directly in person.
#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology? 
Some limitations to the website that could be improved with digital technology is being easier to navigate. Considering the vast population of people who became unemployed in the past year due to the  pandemic, there was a large growth in the population that would need to access this website. As a result, the accessibility must be open to all of these users. Despite that, the website is overwhelming at first glance and could deter many people to applying. Furthermore, it is somewhat time-consuming for the users to learn what needs to be done in order to receive unemployment benefits as well. This could be technologically solved if the design and layout were to become simpler and easier-to-navigate to increase accessibility. 

### Step 2: Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Demographic: People who are of working age that have been unemployed or have reduced hours.
Preference: Users are able to easily access the website for governmental support and assistance in an easy, efficient, and timely manner. 
Expertise: Users should not need any expertise to access this website outside of understanding how to use the internet and basic website navigation. 
#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users have a few options when applying for government unemployment benefits. They can either go to an in-person office to apply, however this might not be possible right now due to the pandemic. Otherwise, users could be in the comfort of their home, or out and about if they choose to apply over the phone. Users could also be outside at a cafe using a laptop or at the beach on their phone if they were to apply using the internet. 
#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
The users would typically need to find information on how to qualify for unemployment benefits, which could be through word-of-mouth or individual research. After that, users would then apply on paper or digitally. Users would then receive physical mail to know how much they would be receiving, the frequency of their payments, and the status of their claim. There is also a digitized option to receive this information by receiving phone calls or e-mails. 

### Step 3: Pick Research Methods (or a combination of methods) 
The observation methods used were a combination of participatory observation and interview with a friend who fits my target activity details. 
Both participatory observation and interview were conducted over Zoom, where my participant was seated at their desk at home. This is also a typical location for users applying for unemployment benefits. 
I used Zoom to record the meeting.
