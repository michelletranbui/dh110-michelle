# Contextual Inquiry: Users in Context 
## Digital Humanities 110 - Michelle Tran Bui 
### Step 1: The Main Design Challenge 
#### What is the main activity your project would support the users in doing? 
#### What is the basic need involved for that activity? 
#### What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs? 
#### What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology? 

### Step 2: Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
#### Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
#### What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

### Step 3: Pick Research Methods (or a combination of methods)
