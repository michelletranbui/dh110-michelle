# Slim Palate: A Personalized Recipe App

## Digital Humanities 110 - Michelle Tran Bui

### Introduction

One of the trendiest chefs in social media, Joshua Weissman is popular on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram because of his bright, comedic personality that presents easy-to-follow and great tasting recipes. Considering that many college students move out for the first time in the beginning of their academic career, Joshua's videos and short snippets are great resources to learn dishes that range from simple, 20 minute recipes to extragavant, rich-tasting dinners that looks like they were from a boujee restaurant. One of his first platforms on the internet was his own personal blog and recipe website, Slim Palate, which he started when he was only 16 years old. His last recipe post is dated back to 2017, and now he's currently 25 years old.

This project is focused on creating a user-friendly cooking website that has a plethora of recipes that are easy to access, find, and use. The website helps specific audiences ie. powerlifters, athletes, or the elderly to find recipes that suit their dietary needs, and time allotment.

### Design Statement

The issue is that there aren't many recipe apps and websites out there that offer personalized features for the user. Many home-chefs and just people in general sometimes have very specific nutritious goals that recipe apps can't accomodate to, and the design of Slim Palate is to address those shortcomings. It's important to resolve that issue to offer higher personalization to increase overall diet and nutritious health.

#### Usability Testing

Considering the age of his website, the heuristic evaluation of Joshua Weissman's website 'Slim Palate' yields a multitutde of usability issues. One of the most outstanding issues is the flexibility and efficiency to use--the website lacks typical cooking website features like "jump to recipe" or "save recipe", making it more difficult for beginner chefs to navigate and organize recipes. Second, there is little room for user control and freedom. Users on his website can't easily navigate to the previous page they were on, and the only real exit button is navigating back to the beginning. Third, there's not a good match between the system and the real world. The design of the website is very stagnant and unresponsive to user interaction, while the layout is difficult to follow. Joshua Weissman's recipes are also oddly organized and result in user interactions that aren't ideal. A fourt concern is the unorganized and unpleasing aesthetic of the website. The cluttered design is messy and hard-to-navigate, and also sports very boring colors.

A usability test was conducted to understand the website's design and it's resulting impact on the user's ability to complete frequent and common tasks. The test will observe the overall user satisfaction and efficiency of Slim Palate. The first task will ask the user to search for a simple steak recipe, to see how quickly and efficiently users can navigate the website to find what to took. This task questions the website's user control and freedom as users attempt to search for something that they need. The second task will test the website's help and documentation for users who have any questions. The user will be tasked with finding out answers to general questions, and whether or not they can contact someone about the website. The final task will be to start from the home page and look for a new dessert to test the match between the system and the real world, considering that the website's functionality is somewhat cumbersome. In conclusion, the purpose of the usability test is to pinpoint the user experience and overall improve the usability and functionality for the user.

### User Research
#### Contextual Inquiry

A contextual inquiry is conducted to understand the environment in which users would access a certain website. I conducted a contextual inquiry on users who would use the California EDD Unemployments Website to see what features of the website are helpful, inaccessible, and can therefore be improved upon.

### UX Storytelling 

UX Storytelling is important for the purpose of understanding what the user needs, accomodating their motivations and desires, and to make their experience as easy, memorable, and satisfactory as possible. For my project, UX storytelling is imperative so I can modify and adjust Slim Palate to cater to a wide variety of people--from students, to full-time workers, and more. By imagining different populations of users, I can diversify the features, effectiveness, and utility of the website.

### Low-Fidelity Prototype

The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is to see whether the features being introduced are implemented properly, are useful to the audience, and if there are any issues with them. By having participants use the features and see any difficulties or advantages that they experience, I can further the advancement of these features by better modifying them. The tasks will specifically ask the user if the features are useful, if there's anything odd about them that can be improved on, and if the user can find out how to use the feature itself.

### High-Fidelity Prototype

The purpose of the high-fidelity prototype is to see whether or not my design of 'Slim Palate' is cognitively functional, if the impression on users is positive or negative, and what further user feedback can be discovered to adjust and improve the prototype. The prototyping also serves to discover any mistakes in the design and to fix them immediately to ensure that the user experience is simple and seamless.
