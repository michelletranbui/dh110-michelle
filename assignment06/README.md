# Interactive Prototypying

## Digital Humanities 110 by Michelle Tran Bui 

### Description
This project focuses on being able to visualize and design a new 'Slim Palate' website in order to conceptualize the aesthetics of the website, the usability and efficiency in the eyes of the user, and the materialization and incorporation of tasks introduced to the website. 

#### Purpose
The purpose of the high-fidelity prototype is to see whether or not my design of 'Slim Palate' is cognitively functional, if the impression on users is positive or negative, and what further user feedback can be discovered to adjust and improve the prototype. The prototyping also serves to discover any mistakes in the design and to fix them immediately to ensure that the user experience is simple and seamless.

#### Tasks
The tasks that will be demonstrated will be the incorporation of three features: 

##### Favorites Bookmark

The Favorites Bookmark gives the user the ability to save recipes they want to use in the future, and users can access all their favorited recipes in a specific tab.

##### Recipe Time Tool 

The Recipe Time tool finds recipes that is within the time frame you need it to be, allowing the user to personalize their needs and find what they need faster. 

##### Recommendation Tool

The Recommendation tool compiles user ratings and reviews on the recipe and recommends which recipes are the most popular with the highest ratings.
