# Low Fidelity Prototype
## Digital Humanities 110 - Michelle Tran Bui 
### Overview
**Description:** This project is focused on creating a user-friendly cooking website that has a plethora of recipes that are easy to access, find, and use. The website helps specific audiences ie. powerlifters, athletes, or the elderly to find recipes that suit their dietary needs, and time allotment. These three features will be introduced to the website to improve user experience and ease of access.
> **Recipe Time Tool**: Finds recipes that is within the time frame you need it to be. 

> **Favorites Bookmark**: Gives the user the ability to save recipes they want to use in the future, and users can access all their favorited recipes in a specific tab.

> **Recommendation Tool**: Compiles user ratings and reviews on the recipe and recommends which recipes are the most popular with the highest ratings.

**Purpose:** The purpose of creating asnd testing this low-fidelity prototype is to see whether the features being introduced are implemented properly, are useful to the audience, and if there are any issues with them. By having participants use the features and see any difficulties or advantages that they experience, I can further the advancement of these features by better modifying them. The tasks will specifically ask the user if the features are useful, if there's anything odd about them that can be improved on, and if the user can find out how to use the feature itself.

#### Notes on Wireflow Test

**Task 1: The Favorites Bookmark**
> The user noted that the Favorites Bookmark is useful and something they would use in the feature. They said that it's not difficult to find and follows natural logic to find, and explained that their difficulty in finding it was just not looking at the website properly. Based off of their usage, I don't think there is much to modify to improve the feature.
