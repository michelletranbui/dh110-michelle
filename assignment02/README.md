## Usability Testing by Michelle Tran Bui
One of the trendiest chefs in social media, Joshua Weissman is popular on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram because of his bright, comedic personality that presents easy-to-follow and great tasting recipes. Considering that many college students move out for the first time in the beginning of their academic career, Joshua's videos and short snippets are great resources to learn dishes that range from simple, 20 minute recipes to extragavant, rich-tasting dinners that looks like they were from a boujee restaurant. One of his first platforms on the internet was his own personal blog and recipe website, Slim Palate, which he started when he was only 16 years old. His last recipe post is dated back to 2017, and now he's currently 25 years old. 

Considering the age of his website, the heuristic evaluation of Joshua Weissman's website 'Slim Palate' yields a multitutde of usability issues. One of the most outstanding issues is the flexibility and efficiency to use--the website lacks typical cooking website features like "jump to recipe" or "save recipe", making it more difficult for beginner chefs to navigate and organize recipes. Second, there is little room for user control and freedom. Users on his website can't easily navigate to the previous page they were on, and the only real exit button is navigating back to the beginning. Third, there's not a good match between the system and the real world. The design of the website is very stagnant and unresponsive to user interaction, while the layout is difficult to follow. Joshua Weissman's recipes are also oddly organized and result in user interactions that aren't ideal. A fourt concern is the unorganized and unpleasing aesthetic of the website. The cluttered design is messy and hard-to-navigate, and also sports very boring colors. 

Considering these factors, I'll be conducting a usability test to fully understand whether the website's design has an impact on the user's ability to complete frequent and common tasks. The test will observe the overall user satisfaction and efficiency of Slim Palate. The first task will ask the user to search for a simple steak recipe, to see how quickly and efficiently users can navigate the website to find what to took. This task questions the website's user control and freedom as users attempt to search for something that they need. The second task will test the user's ability to save a recipe to their desktop or laptop. The objective of this task is to observe the user flexibility and efficiency of use considering that it is very common to save recipes for future dishes. The final task will be to start from the home page and look for a new recipe to test the match between the system and the real world, considering that the website's functionality is somewhat cumbersome. In conclusion, the purpose of the usability test is to pinpoint the user experience and overall improve the usability and functionality for the user.
