## Usability Testing by Michelle Tran Bui
One of the trendiest chefs in social media, Joshua Weissman is popular on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram because of his bright, comedic personality that presents easy-to-follow and great tasting recipes. Considering that many college students move out for the first time in the beginning of their academic career, Joshua's videos and short snippets are great resources to learn dishes that range from simple, 20 minute recipes to extragavant, rich-tasting dinners that looks like they were from a boujee restaurant. One of his first platforms on the internet was his own personal blog and recipe website, Slim Palate, which he started when he was only 16 years old. His last recipe post is dated back to 2017, and now he's currently 25 years old. 

Considering the age of his website, the heuristic evaluation of Joshua Weissman's website 'Slim Palate' yields a multitutde of usability issues. One of the most outstanding issues is the flexibility and efficiency to use--the website lacks typical cooking website features like "jump to recipe" or "save recipe", making it more difficult for beginner chefs to navigate and organize recipes. Second, there is little room for user control and freedom. Users on his website can't easily navigate to the previous page they were on, and the only real exit button is navigating back to the beginning. Third, there's not a good match between the system and the real world. The design of the website is very stagnant and unresponsive to user interaction, while the layout is difficult to follow. Joshua Weissman's recipes are also oddly organized and result in user interactions that aren't ideal. A fourt concern is the unorganized and unpleasing aesthetic of the website. The cluttered design is messy and hard-to-navigate, and also sports very boring colors. 

Considering these factors, I'll be conducting a usability test to fully understand whether the website's design has an impact on the user's ability to complete frequent and common tasks. The test will observe the overall user satisfaction and efficiency of Slim Palate. The first task will ask the user to search for a simple steak recipe, to see how quickly and efficiently users can navigate the website to find what to took. This task questions the website's user control and freedom as users attempt to search for something that they need. The second task will test the website's help and documentation for users who have any questions. The user will be tasked with finding out answers to general questions, and whether or not they can contact someone about the website. The final task will be to start from the home page and look for a new dessert to test the match between the system and the real world, considering that the website's functionality is somewhat cumbersome. In conclusion, the purpose of the usability test is to pinpoint the user experience and overall improve the usability and functionality for the user. 

## Usability Testing Information 

For my usability test, I conducted it in my apartment using my personal computer. I used OBS Studio to record my usability test, which recorded the screen, the user, the audio, and some of me. This usability test is a pilot test, and my boyfriend was the user. 

The process of the usability follows: 
 1. Intro 
 2. Background questions
 3. Previous experience questions
 4. Pre-test questions
 5. Tasks
 6. Post-test questions
 7. SUS questionnaire
 8. Product satisfaction card
 9. Demographics 
 
Easy of use, frequency of use, learning ability, trustworthiness, aesthetic, accesibility, and user satisfaction was measured throughout the usability test through multiple choice questions, short answer, paragraph, and Likert scales.

## Reflection 

During the pilot test, I was able to learn what the general user experience is like when using Slim Palate. I was shown that the general layout is busy and a little overwhelming to navigate, but albeit still simple to use. Things that went well with the experience was the comfortability between me, the moderator, and the participant in the usability test. My user was able to complete each task with little to no difficulty, hence the lack of questions being asked. Through the usability test, my understanding was improved to realize that there are general cosmetic and aesthetic issues with Slim Palate, but the general layout is natural to follow. I personally do think that there are multiple improvements that could be made to make the experience much more efficient and easy-to-use, like simple buttons for recipes such as 'save' and 'jump to recipe'. 

With the usability test in mind, I also learned how the moments of silence are okay and natural in this type of experimenting process. At times, I also felt that my user was glossing over the tasks and speeding it through a little to quickly, where they didn't think about the little functions that make the usability experience more enjoyable. 

Overall, I think the pilot test went well and smoothly. The website was ready to access and the survey/questionairre process passed by without any inconveniences or issues. There were a few typos through the moderator script that caught me off guard and messed up the general flow of the usability process, but there were no major issues that impeded the usability testing. Considering these issues, I think that I can definitely improve on the usability testing process and create more complex tasks that will question the user experience more deeply.
